## Usage

The API documentation of this library can be found at
[docs.rs/tic](https://docs.rs/tic/)

## Performance and Example

Performance is a top-priority. To test performance, we use tic to benchmark itself.

```shell
cargo run --release --example benchmark -- --help
cargo run --release --example benchmark
```

## Features

* high throughput - millions of samples per second
* latched histogram - for analyzing the full distribution of sample lengths
* heatmaps - to generate distribution traces and waterfalls
* meters - to expose readings for client usage
* http metrics - simple metrics on http for scraping and monitoring, Prometheus compatible
* generic - channel type is generic, and used to label the type of sample
* flexible - per channel stats are accessible by registering appropriate `Interest`s
